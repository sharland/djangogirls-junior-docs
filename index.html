					<h2>Welcome</h2>
		      <p>Welcome to the tutorial for Django girls junior.  This tutorial is aimed at those junior devs who are just getting started on the development road (although we hope that those of any age may get something out of this tutorial as well!).  The full tutorial is found <a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/">here</a> and therefore this one also uses the same CC license below.</p>
		      <p>Now that you have been using the web for a few years you might be curious about what lies under the surface of a website.  This tutorial will take you on an exciting adventure in learning how to build your own dynamic website.</p>
		      <p>Remember that along the way you will be doing all sorts of activities.  Things might get a little bit confusing or even go wrong but there is help at hand. We encourage you to keep on no matter what!</p>

						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>Have you ever felt that the world is more and more about technology to which we can't relate?</p></section>
		      <section>Have you ever looked at one of these fancy websites and wondered how did they make it work in the way it does?</section>
		      <section><p>We are here to let you know that ...</p>

				<section id="programming">
					<p> </p>
		      <p>Programming is not as hard as you think</p>
		      <p>In fact it can be quite fun and we want to show that the tools you will learn about can be enjoyable to use and create powerful systems</p>
		      <p>You do not need to be a super-whiz programmer in order to do this.  You will learn a lot on the way and we also have some suggestions about resources you can use online to help with your journey towards becomming a programmer.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="learning">
					<h2>What will you be learning?</h2>
					<p>In this tutorial you will be learning how to create a web application: your own blog.  We will show you how to put it online, so others will see your work!</p>
					<p>It will look like this ...</p>
					<p>Include picture of blog xyz</p>

				<section id="home">
					<h2>Following this tutorial at home</h2>
					<p>We understand that not everyone would be able to make it into a Django Girls Junior course.  We therefore encourage you to follow this tutorial at home.  There are also a ton of other resources online to help you with Django and Python.  More details on the next slide.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="resources">
					<h2>Further Resources for Python and Django</h2>
					<p>There is a lot more out there - these are just to get you started</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0hNd2uW8jTR5K3KBzRuG2A">Coding is for Girls YouTube Channel - Python</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://snakify.org">Snakify Python 3 interactive tutorials and problems</a></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section id="installation">
					<h2>Installation instructions</h2>
					<p>Django is written using the Python programming language and therefore editing it will require the use of software which can create Python scripts.</p>
					<p>The next slides will look at installation instructions for your own machine.  If you are working through this tutorial in a school computer lab it is likely that python should have been already installed.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="installationmac">
					<h2>Installation on macOS</h2>
					<p><i>Note: Before you install Python on macOS you should ensure that your Mac settings allow for installing packages that aren't from the App store. Go to System Preferences (it's in the Applications folder), click Security and Privacy and then the General tab.  If your "Allow apps downloaded from:" is set to "Mac App store" change it to "Mac App Store and identified developers"</i></p>
					<p>Go to <a href="http://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">Python.org</a> and select the latest version 3 release for Python.  This will download a pkg file to your Mac.  Once it is downloaded double click this file to start installation.  A new Python application will be added to your applications folder on your Mac</p>

						<!-- The sub tag isn't rendered correctly by the template NB: must add support to CSS file-->
						<sub>For readers at home: this chapter is covered in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM9yAA09wdc">How the Internet Works</a> video.</sub>
						<sub>This chapter is inspired by the talk <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jesstess/www/">"How the Internet works" by Jessica McKellar.</a></sub>
					<p>We bet that you use the Internet every day.  But do you know what happens when you type an address like <a href="https://djangogirls.org">https://djangogirls.org</a> into your browser's address bar and press enter?</p>
					<p>This section will take you through some of the basics of how the Internet works so that you feel more confident when talking about Internet technology.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="howinternetworks2">
						<h3>What is a website?</h3>
						<p>A website is a collection of files saved on a computer elsewhere in the world.  These files could include pictures, videos and other stuff which you can download but all of this information is presented in web pages.  A web page is a file consisting of Hyper Text Markup Language.</p>
						<p>HTML is not a programming language but is instead used to create webpages which a web browser such as Chrome or Internet Explorer can read, load and display.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="howinternetworks3">
						<h3>Where are these web files stored?</h3>
						<p>Whenever you go to a webserver such as <a href="https://djangogirls.org">https://djangogirls.org</a> the pages which you view from that website are stored on their webserver.  A webserver is simply a more powerful computer called a server which is connected to the Internet.  The djangogirls server is located in California!</p>
					</section>
					<section id="howinternetworks4">
						<h3>What does the internet look like?</h3>
						<p>This is a very simple representation of what the internet looks like - it is a lot more complicated but this is a good starting point.</p>
						<p><img src="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/how_the_internet_works/images/internet_1.png" /></p>
					</section>
					<section id="howinternetworks4">
						<p>That 'net' of connections gives you an idea of how the many computers on the internet connect.  To give you an example of the scale of the internet take a look at the map of the underwater internet cables found at <a href="http://submarinecablemap.com/">submarinecablemap.com</a><p>

						<h2>Introduction to the command line</h2>
						<sub>For readers at home: this chapter is covered in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvZLWhkzX-8">Your new friend: Command Line video.</a></sub>
						<p>In this section we are going to write some of our first code - this is quite exciting so let's begin!</p>
						<p>Please note that throughout this slidedeck we use the terms 'directory' and 'folder' interchangeably but they are one and the same thing.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="commandline2">
						<h3>What is the command line?</h3>
						<p>The window, which is usually called the command line or command-line interface, is a text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer. It's much like Windows Explorer or Finder on the Mac, but without the graphical interface. Other names for the command line are: cmd, CLI, prompt, console or terminal.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="commandline3">
						<h3>Open the command-line interface</h3>
						<p>To start some experiments we need to open our command-line first</p>
