      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the tutorial for Django girls junior.  This tutorial is aimed at those junior devs who are just getting started on the development road (although we hope that those of any age may get something out of this tutorial as well!).  The full tutorial is found <a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/">here</a> and therefore this one also uses the same CC license below.</p>

      <p>Remember that along the way you will be doing all sorts of activities.  Things might get a little bit confusing or even go wrong but there is help at hand. We encourage you to keep on no matter what!</p>
